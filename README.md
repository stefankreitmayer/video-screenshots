# Video Screenshots

A quick and dirty Python script to extract screenshots from a video file

## Dependencies

This script assumes that [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org) is installed.

Moreover, it uses the [moviepy](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy) library to determine the duration of the video.

`pip install moviepy`

## Execution

For convenient testing and tweaking, all the input parameters are hardcoded in the script. Modify them as needed and run:

`python screenshots.py`
